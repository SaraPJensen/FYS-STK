    "## Regression analysis, overarching aims\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression modeling deals with the description of  the sampling distribution of a given random variable $y$ and how it varies as function of another variable or a set of such variables $\\boldsymbol{x} =[x_0, x_1,\\dots, x_{n-1}]^T$. \n",
    "The first variable is called the **dependent**, the **outcome** or the **response** variable while the set of variables $\\boldsymbol{x}$ is called the independent variable, or the predictor variable or the explanatory variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "A regression model aims at finding a likelihood function $p(\\boldsymbol{y}\\vert \\boldsymbol{x})$, that is the conditional distribution for $\\boldsymbol{y}$ with a given $\\boldsymbol{x}$. The estimation of  $p(\\boldsymbol{y}\\vert \\boldsymbol{x})$ is made using a data set with \n",
    "* $n$ cases $i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1$ \n",
    "\n",
    "* Response (target, dependent or outcome) variable $y_i$ with $i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1$ \n",
    "\n",
    "* $p$ so-called explanatory (independent or predictor) variables $\\boldsymbol{x}_i=[x_{i0}, x_{i1}, \\dots, x_{ip-1}]$ with $i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1$ and explanatory variables running from $0$ to $p-1$. See below for more explicit examples.   \n",
    "\n",
    " The goal of the regression analysis is to extract/exploit relationship between $\\boldsymbol{y}$ and $\\boldsymbol{x}$ in or to infer causal dependencies, approximations to the likelihood functions, functional relationships and to make predictions, making fits and many other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regression analysis, overarching aims II\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an experiment in which $p$ characteristics of $n$ samples are\n",
    "measured. The data from this experiment, for various explanatory variables $p$ are normally represented by a matrix  \n",
    "$\\mathbf{X}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ is called the *design\n",
    "matrix*. Additional information of the samples is available in the\n",
    "form of $\\boldsymbol{y}$ (also as above). The variable $\\boldsymbol{y}$ is\n",
    "generally referred to as the *response variable*. The aim of\n",
    "regression analysis is to explain $\\boldsymbol{y}$ in terms of\n",
    "$\\boldsymbol{X}$ through a functional relationship like $y_i =\n",
    "f(\\mathbf{X}_{i,\\ast})$. When no prior knowledge on the form of\n",
    "$f(\\cdot)$ is available, it is common to assume a linear relationship\n",
    "between $\\boldsymbol{X}$ and $\\boldsymbol{y}$. This assumption gives rise to\n",
    "the *linear regression model* where $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = [\\beta_0, \\ldots,\n",
    "\\beta_{p-1}]^{T}$ are the *regression parameters*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression gives us a set of analytical equations for the parameters $\\beta_j$.\n",

We could think of these data as a result of an experiment or a complicated numerical experiment. These data are functions of a series of variables $\\boldsymbol{x}=[x_0,x_1,\\dots,x_{n-1}]$, that is $y_i = y(x_i)$ with $i=0,1,2,\\dots,n-1$. The variables $x_i$ could represent physical quantities like time, temperature, position etc. We assume that $y(x)$ is a smooth function. \n",
